      <h2>The burden of perfection</h2>
      <h3>2020-07-02</h3>
      <p>When I began developing websites, it was a very freeing exercise.
      The editor was a blank canvas, and its artifact was visible by
      everyone anywhere anytime.</p>
      <p>I built my first projects not because I was trying to get a career
      in software or anything like that. It was just curiosity mixed with some
      vanity.</p>
      <p>What exactly did I want everyone to see? Oh my. Those early
      artifacts are unsurprisingly cringe. Very
      sentimental, very self-involved ramblings of a 19-year-old
      mostly-introvert-dabbling-in-extroversion.</p>
      <p><em>LOOK AT ME WAIT DONT LOOK AT ME NEVER MIND</em></p>
      <p>Give a mouse a megaphone and they become frightened of their own
      squeaks.</p>
      <p>If you are a human, you have habits, and some of them are bad
      habits.  If you are like me, one of your bad habits is needing a sense
      of control, and therefore needing your Things to be perfect in order to
      exist, obviously.</p>
      <p>So despite your vision of your online parade, none of your editor's
      artifacts get into your online parade unless they are perfect
      artifacts. Obviously.</p>
      <p>Fast-forward two decades with no lasting presence. This has mostly been fine?</p>
      <p>Mostly. And yet, I still *value* presence online of *others.* The
      presence of others has helped me. I've been able to do what I do
      because of people putting things online. I owe my livelihood to it.
      The web.</p>
      <p>This is starting to hit me. I've stayed mostly quiet, admittedly
      out of fear. Fear still lurks a bit.</p>
      <p>But what if I stopped being quiet for a while? What could it look
      like? Maybe there's something to offer? Might I rekindle some of the
      energy that pushed me into this world in the first place? There was
      something that brought me here. What did it mean to me, and where did
      it go?</p>
      <p>Twenty years later I might find it. If you're here to see what I find,
      welcome.</p>
